      <h1>I gotta piss</h1>
      <p>
        The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of
        the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name
        of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of
        darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost
        children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and
        furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.
        And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.
      </p>

      <h1>I gotta piss</h1>

        Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This
        gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you
        believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes
        with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually
        proud of that shit.
      </p>

      <h1>I'm serious as a heart attack</h1>
      <p>
        You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a
        mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder.
        After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know
        exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us
        survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath,
        that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the
        other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle
        to man.
